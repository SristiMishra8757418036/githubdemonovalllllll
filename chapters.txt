A novel is a relatively long work of narrative fiction, typically written in
 prose and published as a book. The English word 
to describe such a work derives from the 
Italian: novella for "new", "news", or "short story of something new",
 itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the 
neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning "new".[1] According 
to Margaret Doody, the novel has "a continuous and co
mprehensive history of about two thousand years", 
with its origins in the Ancient Greek
 and Roman novel, in Chivalric romance, and i
n the tradition of the Italian Renaissance no
vella.[2] The ancient romance form was 
revived by Romanticism, in the historical 
romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novella
